# AgentBox Development Notes (For Agents)

**Note**: Also read README.md for user-facing features, command usage, and Git authentication setup.

## Technical Context

### Project Origin
AgentBox is a simplified replacement for ClaudeBox. The user was maintaining patches to ClaudeBox but wanted to stop due to complexity. Key motivations:
- ClaudeBox has 1000+ users but too many features the user doesn't need
- Complex slot system and Bash 3.2 compatibility requirements made it hard to maintain
- Python profile in ClaudeBox was buggy
- User wanted automatic behavior without prompts

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Ephemeral Containers**: Containers use `--rm` flag and are destroyed on exit. This differs from ClaudeBox's persistent slot-based containers.

2. **Hash-Based Naming**: Container names use SHA256 hash of project directory path (first 12 chars) to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts.

3. **Multi-Instance Support**: Automatically detects running containers and appends numeric suffixes (`-2`, `-3`, etc.) to enable multiple simultaneous Claude instances for the same project. Uses `get_next_instance()` to find the next available instance number by checking `docker ps` for existing containers.

4. **Volume Strategy**:
   - **Claude auth volume**: Shared across all instances (`agentbox-claude-<hash>`) to avoid re-authentication
   - **MCP data volumes**: Separate per instance (`agentbox-mcp-<hash>-2`) to avoid database conflicts
   - **Package caches**: Separate per instance to avoid concurrent access issues
   - **Shell history**: Separate per instance for isolation
   - All volumes use Docker named volumes (not bind mounts) to avoid permission issues. Claude volume initialized from `~/.claude` if it exists.

5. **SSH Implementation**: Currently mounts `~/.agentbox/ssh/` directory directly (not true SSH agent forwarding). Future improvement could use Docker's `--ssh` flag for better security.

6. **UID/GID Handling**: Dockerfile builds with host user's UID/GID passed as build args to minimize permission issues, but some remain (see ZSH history issue).

7. **Multi-Workspace Support**: The `--workspaces` flag accepts comma-separated paths and mounts them sequentially as `/workspace2`, `/workspace3`, etc. Implementation uses `mount_additional_workspaces()` function with bash nameref parameters for efficient array manipulation. Validates directory existence and logs each mount operation.

## Implementation Details

### File Responsibilities
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build with all language toolchains. Uses `USER claude` (UID 1000)
- `entrypoint.sh`: Minimal - only sets PATH and creates Python venvs
- `agentbox`: Main logic - rebuild detection, container lifecycle, mount management

### Rebuild Detection
Uses SHA256 hash of Dockerfile + entrypoint.sh stored as Docker image label. Compares on each run to trigger automatic rebuilds.

### Container Lifecycle
1. Check Docker daemon
2. Compare hashes â†’ rebuild if needed
3. Clean up old containers using outdated image
4. Run ephemeral container with all mounts
5. Container removed automatically on exit

### Mount Points
```bash
/workspace              # Project directory (main mount, always current dir)
/workspace2             # Additional workspace (via --workspaces flag)
/home/claude/.ssh       # SSH keys from ~/.agentbox/ssh/
/home/claude/.gitconfig # Git config (read-only)
/home/claude/.npm       # NPM cache
/home/claude/.cache/pip # Pip cache
/home/claude/.m2        # Maven cache
/home/claude/.gradle    # Gradle cache
/home/claude/.zsh_history   # ZSH history
/home/claude/.bash_history  # Bash history
/home/claude/.claude    # Claude config (Docker volume)
```

## Testing Status
- Basic functionality verified (help command, shell mode)
- Full Docker build/run cycle needs real environment testing
- Multi-project isolation designed but not stress-tested
- SSH operations need testing with actual Git repositories

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **True SSH Agent Forwarding**: Replace key mounting with Docker's `--ssh` flag
2. **Build Cache Optimization**: Better layer ordering for faster rebuilds
3. **Permission Fixes**: Solve ZSH history permission issue properly
4. **Debug Mode**: Add verbose logging for troubleshooting
5. **Config File**: Support `.agentboxrc` for user preferences
6. **WSL2 Optimizations**: Specific handling for WSL2 environments

## Known Technical Issues

### Claude CLI Triple Display
- **Root Cause**: Ink framework's TTY handling in containers
- **Attempted Fixes**: Terminal size handling, TTY allocation modes
- **Status**: Unfixable without Claude CLI framework changes

### ZSH History Permissions
- **Root Cause**: Host file ownership (host UID) vs container user (UID 1000)
- **Attempted Fixes**: Various permission strategies, all had side effects
- **Status**: Cosmetic issue, functionality works

### Image Size
Current image is large (~2GB) due to multiple language toolchains. Could optimize with:
- Multi-stage builds with slimmer final stage
- Optional language support via build args
- Better layer caching strategies

## Development Philosophy

1. **Simplicity First**: Resist feature creep. The value is in being simpler than ClaudeBox.
2. **Automatic Behavior**: Users shouldn't need to think about container management.
3. **No Prompts**: Everything should work without user interaction (except initial SSH setup).
4. **Fail Gracefully**: Clear error messages, automatic recovery where possible.

## Command Analysis

The `agentbox` script has these key functions:
- `check_docker()`: Verify Docker daemon is running
- `calculate_hash()`: SHA256 hash for change detection
- `needs_rebuild()`: Compare hashes with image label
- `build_image()`: Docker build with proper args
- `cleanup_old_containers()`: Remove containers using old images
- `mount_additional_workspaces()`: Mount extra workspace directories as /workspace2, /workspace3, etc.
- `run_container()`: Main container execution logic with workspace collection
- `ssh_setup()`: Initialize ~/.agentbox/ssh/ directory

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Never use `-i` flag**: Git commands like `git rebase -i` won't work in non-interactive container context

2. **Path Hashing**: Container names use first 12 chars of SHA256(project_path) - collision risk is negligible

3. **Volume Naming**: `agentbox-claude-<hash>` pattern ensures per-project isolation

4. **Shell Mode**: When using `shell` command, execution goes through zsh even for bash (ensures environment is loaded)

5. **Admin Mode**: `--admin` flag doesn't actually grant sudo (would need Dockerfile changes) - currently just shows a message

## File Count
- Core files: 3 (Dockerfile, entrypoint.sh, agentbox)
- Documentation: 2 (README.md, DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md)
- Other: .gitignore, LICENSE, CLAUDE.md
- Total: ~8 files (vs ClaudeBox's 20+)
