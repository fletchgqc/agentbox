description: Performs git operations and interacts with GitHub. Used when git-related operations are needed, including: git commands (commit, push, pull, branch, merge, etc.), GitHub API interactions, gh CLI operations, pull request operations, issue analysis and operations.
---
# GitHub Integration
- Always use gh CLI for GitHub operations when possible. Authentication is automatically taken care of by the GH_TOKEN environment variable.
- Fall back to GitHub API when gh CLI isn't suitable

# When committing code
- Create a git commit message which summarises the changes being committed. Include what was changed and why the changes were made, using the conversation history to determine the why if possible.

## Challenge your "why"
- After drafting a "why" part, challenge yourself: would a reader be able to easily determine this themselves from the "what"? If so, don't include the "why", since it is superfluous.

# Improvements
- If you solve any problems with github integration, for example with `gh` authentication not working out of the box, summarise for the user what problem you solved and how after you finish the task. This information will be used to improve the skill in future.
